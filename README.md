# LoanApproval-Prediction
Loan Approval Prediction System using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and KNN.
##  Project Overview
This project is a Supervised Machine Learning based Loan Approval Prediction System.  
It predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not based on applicant details and financial information.

The system uses classification algorithms to analyze credit risk and make predictions.

---

##  Objective
To build a machine learning model that can classify loan applications as Approved or Rejected using supervised learning techniques.

---

##  Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Among these models, *Naive Bayes* performed the best based on accuracy comparison.

---

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Accuracy Comparison

---

## Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

---
